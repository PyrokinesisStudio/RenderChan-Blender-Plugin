# RenderChan Blender Plugin
A plugin for Blender that will render various file formats before importing them.

This project uses [RenderChan](https://github.com/morevnaproject/RenderChan) and will probably be moved to [https://github.com/morevnaproject](https://github.com/morevnaproject)'s account after the first stable version has been finished.
